                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em>studio mose </em><br><em>&nbsp;<br></em>An Antwerp based art-direction and production studio founded in September 2017&nbsp;<br><br>studio mose started as an Antwerp based sustainable art and styling studio recontextualizing finely selected secondhand clothing and thereby not supporting the polluting fast fashion industry but ethical, handmade, and thrifted fashion. By thrifting clothes you are not voting for the fastfashion industry (Zara, H&amp;M, Berschka...) and thereby not supporting cruelty. <br>Cruelty towards our planet (massive pollution!). You are also not supporting bad working conditions and child labour. Know what you vote for with your money, because by buying at those shops means supporting them and all the horrible things they don't want you to know. Together we can make a change, thrift and still look damn good! I know it's amazing how cheap these shops are, especially for those who don't have a big budget and want to look trendy. But clearly someone is paying for it: the people/children who work for these corporate companies. <br>Just think about who you want to support with your money. This doesn't mean you have to shop at expensive brands, this means you have to do your research about these fast fashion companies, what they do and what kind of working conditions you are supporting. Also, just shop less and be more creative: swap with friends, go thrifting or adjust your clothes and maybe buy a book or CD instead, if you really have the urge to satisfy your shopaholic needs. I truly care and that doesn't mean that you have to care as well, I just hope to inspire people who also care more about lives than looks. <br>Every month fresh secondhand and vintage finds were placed online in an editorial format. The pictures, casting, styling and creative direction are done by Ines Bodlovic. <br><br>Today studio mose collaborates with other young artistic talents , and has grown into a collaborative production and direction studio that organizes annual secondhand and vintage sales on location.<br><br><br></p>
